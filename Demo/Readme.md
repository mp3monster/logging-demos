# Demo Description



## Setting Up

This scripts assume the book.bat is in the path (this sets up the Java and Groovy environment variables and navigates to the base folders)

The setLocations.bat needs to be modified so that the environment variables point to the correct locations for:

- base directory containing the logSimulator groovy file
- home folder for running the demo



The Slack token will need to be checked / updated.
